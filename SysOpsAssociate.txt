############################ VPC #################################

VPC:( Virtual Private cloud)

when you create a VPC using wizard it will create the following by default
	a) 2 subnets â€“ one private and one public
	b) One NAT Gateway to route traffic from the public to private subnet
	c) One internet gateway attached to the VPC

Custom Route Table:(Associate with Public subnet)
	 a) it should be associate with the public subnet
	 b) this route table contains the entry that enables instance in the subnet to communicate with the other instances in the VPC over Ipv4. and directly with the internet over IPv4. only for EC2 instances


Main Route Table:(Associate with Private subnet) (Comes default with VPC)
 	a) This route table contains an entry that enables instances in the subnet to communicate with other instances in the VPC over IPv4, as well directly with the internet through the **NAT Gateway** over IPv4. only for EC2 instances


VPC endpoints:
	a) private instance communicate with only AWS services S3 and dynamoDB, traffic do not leave the amazon network.

	b) A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service

	i) Interface VPC Endpoints:
		a) it doen't require internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection or AWS Direct connection.

		b) it Enables communication between AWS services using an elastic network interface with private IP's in your Aamzon VPC

	ii) Gateway Endpoints:
		you specify as a target for a route in your route table for traffic destined to a supported AWS service
		only S3 and DynamoDB are supported.


AWS VPN:
	a) AWS VPN links on-premise Network to AWS Network



NAT instance & NAT Gateway: (Subnet to communicate the internet)
	a) Used only for instances in the private subnet in a VPC to communicate with the internet via the public subnet.


AWS Direct Connect:
	-- Establish a dedicated connection between your on-premise to AWS.
	-- Private connection between AWS and your datacenter, office or colocation, reduce the network cost, increase the bandwidth.


egress-only Internet Gateway: (VPC level, IPv6 traffic specifically)
	a) All IPV6 address are public by default. if your instance able to access the internet but prevent resources on internet to communicate with instance.

VPC-flowlogs:
	 a) to troubleshoot why specific port is not reaching an instance in a VPC

VPC Peering: (Routing between multiple VPC within AWS account or cross AWS account)

Expanding VPC:
	You can expand your existing VPC by adding four (4) secondary IPv4 IP ranges (CIDRs) to your VPC. You can shrink your VPC by deleting the secondary CIDR blocks you have added to your VPC. You cannot, however, change the size of the IPv6 address range of your VPC.



Billing:

IAM:
	a) What can this user do in AWS? -- IAM policies
	b) Who can access this S3 bucket? -- S3 Bucket Policies
	c) S3 ACL-- Object specific permission in single bucket.

S3:
	a) for server logs delivered to the target bucket, encryption should be SSE-S3
	b) if large no.of S3 buckets& Each require different set of permissions IAM policy will be easy to manage rather than bucket 	policy.
	c) bucket policy is imposed on whole bucket, and using this cannot give individual permissions on each object in that bucket.
	d) while performing multipart uploads, user must have decrypt permissions, because S3 perform decryption of files and read 	data to complete multipart upload.
	e) S3 ignores query-string parameters that begin with "x-" and parameters included in access log records.
	f) You can't grant root user bucket ACL permissions to IAM user of same account,but can other AWS accounts.
	g) if a bucket has two policies one allow, and other deny, always deny override allow.


AWS WAF (Web Application firewall):(Customization version of AWS Shield service)
	a) Cross-site scriptin
	b) Ip Adress blocking
	c) Lenght of request
	d) SQL Injection
	e) Geographic Match
	f) String Match

AWS Shield:
	a) Manged solution where all security filters are applied by AWS


Route53:
	a) weighted Route policy is used to load balancing test new versions of software.
	b) weigted Route ploicy is used to route traffic between cloud and on-premise location.

############# EC2 #############


1. AWS System Manager Inventory: (collects only metadata from your managed instances)

	b) Automated backups are deleted when you delete RDS instance, can't be recovered.
	c) maximum retention period for automated backups is 35 days
	d) Disaster Recovery RDS: Create a read replica in a different region. In the event of a failover, promote the read replica as the primary and change the DNS for your application to point to the new primary and then enable Multi AZ.

AWS SQS:
