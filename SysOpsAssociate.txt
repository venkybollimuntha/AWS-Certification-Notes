1. DynamoDB:
	a) Enable AutoScaling for DynamoDB table to dynamically adjust provisioned read/write capacity.


Network LoadBalancer uses:(Over classic loadbalancer)
	a) Ability to handle volatile workloads and scale to millions of requests per second

	b) Support Static IP addresses for the load balancer. You can also assaign one Elastic IP per subnet enabled for the load balancer.

	c) Supports for registering targets by IP address, including targets outside the VPC  for the load balancer.

OpsWork:
	a) It is configuration management service of EC2 instances


AWS Direct Connect:
	-- Establish a dedicated connection between your on-premise to AWS.
	-- Private connection between AWS and your datacenter, office or colocation, reduce the network cost, increase the bandwidth.


egress-only Internet Gateway: (VPC level, IPv6 traffic specifically)
	a) All IPV6 address are public by default. if your instance able to access the internet but prevent resources on internet to communicate with instance.

NAT instance & NAT Gateway:
	a) Used only for instances in the private subnet in a VPC to communicate with the internet via the public subnet.

VPC:
	a) if you want your VPC works with both IPV4 and Ipv6, you must ensure the your VPC works on dula-stack mode.

VPC endpoints:
	a) private instance communicate with only AWS services S3 and dynamoDB.

Route53:
	a) weighted Route policy is used to load balancing test new versions of software.

Billing:
	a) cost & usage reports provides comprehensive cost details for all resources in AWS with support of multiple files, adjusting columns in the file.

IAM:
	a) What can this user do in AWS? -- IAM policies
	b) Who can access this S3 bucket? -- S3 Bucket Policies
	c) S3 ACL-- Object specific permission in single bucket.

S3:
	a) for server logs delivered to the target bucket, encryption should be SSE-S3
	b) if large no.of S3 buckets& Each require different set of permissions IAM policy will be easy to manage rather than bucket 	policy.
	c) bucket policy is imposed on whole bucket, and using this cannot give individual permissions on each object in that bucket.
	d) while performing multipart uploads, user must have decrypt permissions, because S3 perform decryption of files and read 		data to complete multipart upload.


AWS WAF(Web Application firewall):(Customization version of AWS Shield service)
	a) Cross-site scripting
	b) Ip Adress blocking
	c) Lenght of request
	d) SQL Injection
	e) Geographic Match
	f) String Match

AWS Shield:
	a) Manged solution where all security filters are applied by AWS

############# EC2 #############
1. AWS System Manager:
	a) State manager is used to command document to keep amazon EC2 in a predefined state.
	b) it will manage and control & control AWS resources 
	c) collecting Operating  System(OS), application and instance metadata.

2. AWS Guard Duty: (VPC Flow logs,CloudTrailEvent logs, DNS logs) (Threat Detection service EC2)
	a) used to include custom IP address for generating findings to detect malicious/Threat activities.
	b) Guard Duty maintains:
		Trusted Ip list & Threat List

3. AWS Config:
	-- tool to audit & Evaluate configuration of AWS resources.
	a) for multi-account, multi-region data aggregation, aws config uses aggregator to collect data.
	b) track configurational changes done to AWS Resources.
	c) AWS config needs to be enabled per region& not globlly


4. AWS Inspector:(EC2 Instances Inspector)
	a) can be used for accessing vulnerability for any ports & services on application installed on EC2, which can 	  be accessed from external networks.
	b) center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks
	c) Security best pracitces for EC2
	d) Runtime behaviour analysis.

5. AWS Trusted Advicer:(Recommendations and Avises for limits)
	a) Usage details of AWS resources whether they are within the service limits for a resource.



AWS QuickSight:
	a) used for interactive dashboards and themes from analysed data.
	b) uses two editions:
		-- Standard (No Encryption at rest)
		-- Enterprise (support Encryption at rest)

AWS EMR:(on-Premise clusters are moved to AWS)
	a) EMR is a managed cluster platform that simplifies running big data frameworks (Apache, Hadoop, apache spark)
	b) EMR used to transform and move large amount of data into and out of other AWS data stores and databases

CloudFormation:
	a) Change sets are used to make changes to the running resources in a stack.
	b) cfn-helper script signals AWS cloudformation to indicate whether EC2 instance have been successfully created or updated.
	c) 

VPC-flowlogs:
	 a) to troubleshoot why specific port is not reaching an instance in a VPC

Interface VPC Endpoints:
	a) it doen't require internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection or AWS Direct connection.

	b) it Enables communication between AWS services using an elastic network interface with private IP's in your Aamzon VPC

AWS Storage Gateway:
	a) AWS service connecting an on-premises software appliance with cloud-based storage



Custom Route Table:(Associate with Public subnet)
	 a) it should be associate with the public subnet
	 b) this route table contains the entry that enables instance in the subnet to communicate with the other instances in the VPC over Ipv4. and directly with the internet over IPv4.


Main Route Table:(Associate with Private subnet)
 	a) This route table contains an entry that enables instances in the subnet to communicate with other instances in the VPC over IPv4, as well directly with the internet through the **NAT Gateway** over IPv4.




######### Notes ############
	a) Security Groups -- VPC level protection
	b) NACL -- subnets in VPC
	c) AWS --> VPC --> AZ1/AZ2 --> Subnets(one or more) --> Route --> InternetGateway --> user
	d) RDS and Redshift have automatic backup options without user intervention.
